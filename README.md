TGT
===
A tiny game toolset.

Don't use, probably bad.
The entity-component-system's API is largely stolen from [here](https://github.com/yagl/ecs).

See documentation [here](https://gggeb.github.io/tgt/docs/index.html).

To Do
-----

 + Add more rendering functions.
 + Keypad support.

Bugs
---

 + In Firefox, when the pointer is locked while not fullscreen, the pointer drifts.
